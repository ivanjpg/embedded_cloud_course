# Embbeded Cloud Course

ESP32 SoC is used for the projects. I will try to code all the examples in two different SDKs, namely Arduino & ESP-IDF.

- Arduino SDK projects will be named: XX_a_PROJECT_NAME
- ESP-IDF SDK projects will be named: XX_PROJECT_NAME

where XX is the project number.

Wish me luck to add diagrams or figures for the circuits.
